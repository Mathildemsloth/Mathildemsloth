👋 Hi there! I'm Mathilde, a passionate master's student in Public Health Science at the University of Copenhagen. I'm currently immersed in  my master's thesis about spousal bereavement, where i'm using causal inference and prediction models. In my master's thesis and with previous work I have worked with register studies, applying my skills to unlock insights from real-world data.

💻 My coding arsenal includes SPSS, STATA, and R. I believe in the power of data to uncover meaningful insights and drive positive change. As I navigate the exciting intersection of health science, technology, and register studies, I'm dedicated to contributing my skills and insights to collaborative projects.

🔍 Exploring the nuances of public health through the lens of data analysis is my forte.
